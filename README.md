# Dedifferentiation Model

### 1. Introduction
Healthy tissue is charaterized by a specific structure, where stem cells are responsible for tissue maintance and give their designated function. Typically stem cells have own self-renewal ability but also differentiate into terminally differenitated cells. Data suggest that tissue homeostasis is maintained through existence of specific negative feedback loop that influence stem cell number and tissue size.     
It is thought that tumors are maintained by so called cancer stem cell(CSC), and that the majority of the tumor is made up of more differentiated cancer cells that have limited ability to maintain the existence of the tumor. Similiarly, it has been suggested that feedback loops which regulate healthy tissue homeostasis are maintained to a certain extent in tumors, and observed tumor growth patterns support this notion.   
Both healthy tissue as well as tumor cell dynamics have been studied with mathematical models in the context of hierachically structured cell population. 

### 2. Biological Model and parameters 
Here, we review the biological cartoon model of stem cell-driven tissue dynamics. In this form, this model contains two population: the stem cells: X0, and the more differentiated cells, X1. This model can correspond to either healthy tissue cell or to tumor cell populations, depending on the scenario to which the model is applied to.

X0 = Stem Cell, X1 = Non-Stem Cell (differentiated cell)    
v0 = divison rate for X0, v1 = division rate for X1   
d0 = death rate for X0, d1 = death rate for X1   
r1 = dedifferentiation rate   
p = self-rewal probability    

### 3. Mathematical Model 
This model is given by the following set of ordinary differential equations.

Stem cells and differentiated cells are assumed to divided with a rate v0 and v1. For the stem cell division rate, this division result in the generation of 2 daughter stem cells with probability p (self-renewal). With a probability 1-p, the divison results in the generation of two differentiated cells. Therefore, divison is assume to be symmetric. Stem cells and differentiated cells are assumed to die with a rate d0 and d1. Finally, differentiatd cells are assumed to de-differentiate into stem cells with a constance r1.    

### 4. Numerical Solution and Stochastic Gillespie Simulation
To analyze the system easier, we have assumed self-renewal probability p = 1, stem cell division rate v0 = 1, and ùõæ =1 .

#### 4.3. System with feedback d0 ‚â† 0 and r1 ‚â† 0

By using linear stability analysis, we have achieved two steady states. For non-trivial steady state to be positive, we have four cases, but case 2 and case 4 fails because of contradiction of inequality. 

![inequality](https://postfiles.pstatic.net/MjAxODEyMDVfMTcx/MDAxNTQ0MDA4NDA4Mzcz.rq11L6PrfVk--9gM6sNvEhJJ6FQlpFXYaqlOBxFxjFQg.nmw958q7dufct9zFCk0LPiJhGuGdb2fnMxPQyGrIAYcg.PNG.nayeonkim93/Screen_Shot_2018-12-05_at_3.07.04_AM.png?type=w773)

Therefore, we are going to observe numerical solution and stochastic solution only for the case 1 and case 3.

### 5. Cancer cell model

#### 5.1. Biological Result from the paper
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death. However, recently, they have found that there are two different efficient treatment for this cancer. 

1. _Gemcitabine(GEM)_   
   GEM has been used chemotherapeutic agen over the past decade. Unfortunately, numerous phase III trials testing GEM combined with other cytotoxic drugs have failed to reveal any additional benefit compared with GEM alone.   
2. _Salinomycin (SAL)_    
   SAL has recently been shown to selectively deplete human breast cancer stem cells, which reduces the proportion of CSCs by > 100 fold relative to paclitaxel. Furthermore, SAL can overcome drug resistance in human cancer cells. More interestingly, SAL may sensitize cancer cells to effect of doxorubicin or etoposide treatment. 

In this paper, they have tested whether SAL alone or combined with GEM is capable of eliminating pancreatic cancer cells. This paper is purely based on biological model instead of mathematcial model. They have tested this on xenograft model of human pancreatic cancer. Both CD133+ and CD133 cells were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of the mice using a 23-gauge needle at a 2 X 10^6 cells per mouse The size and weight of the tumors were monitored every other day. Once the tumors reached a mean diameter of 2‚Äì4 mm, both groups of mice (CD133+ and CD133) were randomized to four subgroups with six animals each. The mice were then treated with vehicle, GEM, SAL or their combination.    

![figure6](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0304383511003077-gr6_lrg.jpg)

Figure A is CD133+ cell and Figure represents CD133- cell. As a result, SAL had marked inhibition on CD133+ and GEM showed better antiproliferative effect on CD133-. Interestingly, combined treatment led to a nearly complete abolishment of both CSCs and differentiated cells in vitro. 

#### 5.2. Parameter Fitting with mathematical model
Because my model is based on population but the model I am looking at is cell volume, I had to do literature search for the conversion. Average cancer stem cells (CSCs) size is 1-10 um ([Qiuhui Li](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651715/)). Therefore, average CSC volume is 5.23 X 10^(-7) when we consider this cells as sphere. Pancreatic cancer cell size measures as average of 11-16 um in diameter ([Angelyn V. Nguyen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5866717/)). So average differenitated pancreatic cell volume is 1.15 X 10^(-5). The data we have extracted is CNT in the figure. The population is including cancer stem cell and differentiated cell. Even our ODE model, differentiated cells are posessed than the stem cells and also biological research found that stem cell fastly differentiat to differentiated cells than as it remain. I assume that proportion of CSC to differentiated cancer cell is 3:7.

       Red label = CD133+ treated with vehicle
       Blue label = CD133- treated with vehicle
       
Based on what I have observed from the previous section. Systems bahave differently with different parameter sets. What I want for the cancer model is diverge from the steady state which I can use the system with feedback d0 = 0 and r1 ‚â† 0 and d1 < v1 + r1 (4.1. case1). But I have modified d0 to delay the growth exponentially. 

![parameter fitting](https://blogfiles.pstatic.net/MjAxODEyMTJfMTE5/MDAxNTQ0NTU2MjUwODE2.j577gqLqkeQ6k6HzRsnW6sw_F41XjXvnmVqXvO-bESsg.d2MxAJVQ_ixlKZ7vVip5Fla-wREANcZjPQXFACQKr0sg.JPEG.nayeonkim93/Tumor_regression_of_xenograft_ODE.jpeg)

      Parameter assumption for CD133+: p = 1, v0 = 1, v1 =7, d0 = 0.3, d1 = 13, ùõæ = 1, r1 = 25 
      Parameter assumption for CD133-: p = 1, v0 = 1, v1 =8, d0 = 0.3, d1 = 13, ùõæ = 1, r1 = 24    
      Red label = CD133+, Blue label = CD133-
     
Both of the CD133+ and CD133- shows the similar behavior so we can play with parameter set little bit to get the different population. With only small change of r1 and v1, we could observe the similar behavior as the xenograft model in vitro.
